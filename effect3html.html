        C (pronounced /ˈsiː/ – like the letter c)[6] is a general-purpose programming language. 
        It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains very widely used and influential. 
        By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.
         It has found lasting use in operating systems code (especially in kernels[7]), device drivers,
        and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing.[8] C is commonly
        used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest
        microcontrollers and embedded systems.

        A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie
        between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing
        the kernel of the Unix operating system.[9] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It
        has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[10][11] with C compilers available
        for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C Programming
        Language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard
        for the language.[12][1] C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute
        (ANSI) and, subsequently, jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the 
        International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

        C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming,
        lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was 
        designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language
        constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal 
        runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed
        to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written
        with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms
        and operating systems with few changes to its source code.

        C is an imperative, procedural language in the ALGOL tradition. 
        It has a static type system. In C, all executable code is contained 
        within subroutines (also called "functions", though not in the sense 
        of functional programming). Function parameters are passed by value,
        although arrays are passed as pointers, i.e. the address of the first
        item in the array. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly
        passing pointers to the thing being referenced.

        The C language also exhibits the following characteristics:
        The language has a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set
        of control flow primitives: if/else, for, do/while, while, and switch.
        User-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of sigil.
        It has a large number of arithmetic, bitwise, and logic operators: +,+=,++,&,||, etc.
        More than one assignment may be performed in a single statement.

      </p>

      <p>
        Functions:
        Function return values can be ignored, when not needed.
        Function and data pointers permit ad hoc run-time polymorphism.
        Functions may not be defined within the lexical scope of other functions.
        Variables may be defined within a function, with scope.
        A function may call itself, so recursion is supported.
      </p>

      <h2 id="three">Section Three</h2>

      <p>
        User-defined (typedef) and compound types are possible.
        Heterogeneous aggregate data types (struct) allow related data elements 
        to be accessed and assigned as a unit. The contents of whole structs 
        cannot be compared using a single built-in operator (the elements must 
        be compared individually). Union is a structure with overlapping members; 
        it allows multiple data types to share the same memory location.
        Array indexing is a secondary notation, defined in terms of pointer
        arithmetic. Whole arrays cannot be assigned or compared using a 
        single built-in operator. There is no "array" keyword in use or definition;
        instead, square brackets indicate arrays syntactically, for example month[11].
        Enumerated types are possible with the enum keyword. They are freely 
        interconvertible with integers. Strings are not a distinct data type,
        but are conventionally implemented as null-terminated character arrays.

        In 1971 Ritchie started to improve B, to use the features of the more-powerful
        PDP-11. A significant addition was a character data type. He called this New B
        (NB).[15] Thompson started to use NB to write the Unix kernel, and his requirements
        shaped the direction of the language development.[15][16] Through to 1972, richer
        types were added to the NB language: NB had arrays of int and char. Pointers, the
        ability to generate pointers to other types, arrays of all types, and types to be 
        returned from functions were all also added. Arrays within expressions became pointers.
        A new compiler was written, and the language was renamed C.[9]

        The preprocessor was introduced around 1973 at the urging of Alan Snyder and also
        in recognition of the usefulness of the file-inclusion mechanisms available in BCPL
        and PL/I. Its original version provided only included files and simple string
        replacements: #include and #define of parameterless macros. Soon after that, 
        it was extended, mostly by Mike Lesk and then by John Reiser, to incorporate macros
        with arguments and conditional compilation.[9]

        Unix was one of the first operating system kernels implemented in a language
        other than assembly. Earlier instances include the Multics system (which was
        written in PL/I) and Master Control Program (MCP) for the Burroughs B5000 
        (which was written in ALGOL) in 1961. In around 1977, Ritchie and Stephen
        C. Johnson made further changes to the language to facilitate portability
        of the Unix operating system. Johnson's Portable C Compiler served as the
        basis for several implementations of C on new platforms.[16]
